<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tracheobronchial Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Expandable Stents</li><li>Non-Expandable Stents</li><li>Balloon-Expandable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tracheobronchial stents market is categorized into three main types: self-expandable stents, non-expandable stents, and balloon-expandable stents. Self-expandable stents automatically expand upon deployment, conforming to the airway structure, while non-expandable stents are rigid and maintain a fixed diameter. Balloon-expandable stents require a balloon for expansion and are positioned precisely before being inflated to ensure optimal airway patency. Each type is designed for specific patient needs, addressing conditions like airway obstruction due to tumors or inflammation.</p></p>
